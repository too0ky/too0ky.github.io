            <p>After getting my Bachelors in History and Pyschology, I embarked on a journey to see the world. Having seen so many beautiful places, I realized that there is something truly uniqiue in the connections we develop with one another, and the best way to stay connected in this digital age is through the internet. This led me down the path of web developement and data analysis. In the last year and a half, I have been teaching myself the nuauces of Python and Javascript, learning about different libraries and tools along the way. With this, I hope to find a suitable job that will help me connect to the world around me.
