            <p>I am a fervent admirer of data analysis, visualization, and web development with a flair for acquiring technical languages. Coupled with excellent critical thinking skills and a unique sense of humor, I am able to achieve deliverables efficiently with a smile. As an educator for the past six years in different international settings, I am an effective communicator and cheerleader to those around me. Finally, my passion for sustainability propels me towards conscious projects with significant impact on our global environment.
